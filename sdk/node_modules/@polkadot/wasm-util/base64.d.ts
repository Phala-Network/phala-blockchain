/**
 * @name base64Decode
 * @description
 * A base64Decoding function that operates in all environments. Unlike decoding
 * from Buffer (Node.js only) or atob (browser-only) this implementation is
 * slightly slower, but it is platform independent.
 *
 * For our usage, since we have access to the static final size (where used), we
 * decode to a specified output buffer. This also means we have applied a number
 * of optimizations based on this - checking output position instead of chars.
