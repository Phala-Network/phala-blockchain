### Build the blockchain and bridge

Make sure you have Rust and LLVM-10 installed.

> Note for Mac users: you also need `llvm` and `binutils` from Homebrew or MacPort, and to add their binaries to your $PATH

Run `git submodule update --init` to fetch submodules before build if you haven't added option `--recursive ` when clone code.

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The build script enforces LLVM-10 or newer is used. LLVM-10 is needed because of the wasm port of rust
crypto library, `ring`. We have to compile the C code into wasm while keeping the compatibility with
the _current_ rustc.
